--immediate
#! make URL detection more robust, check Django documentation on position, SimpleMenu variation
#? add string break for namespacing menu names with app in template filter (only allows one param)
#! check cacheing is working how it should, and is good code
#! enable validation now split from cache, then test disabling works
-- later
#? where would 'attrs' parameter injection be most useful?
#! make multiple handlers and metaclass
#! check template and class activation
#! renaming of ... (lots of things)?
#! 'name' to (for URLs) 'title'
#! try validator operations
#? absolute/reverse URLs
#? trails and URL normalsation (and handler/views?) can be permanently cached?
#! More refined trail options.
#! why no submenu indicators on down menu?
#? real breadcrumbs
#? pushdown menus good for single line, but z-index down better for horizontal bars
#? include menu config, such as theme, in config files...
# : Against is Djangos config convention-'user decision'.
# : For: nice for a user, and its config material.
#? app atttributes and classes can be by extending seeds, like the extension data
#? circular dependencies. Also prescan for missing attributes/ other errors?
