wrap is a rendering property,. 
It goes on the widget, where it is exposed.
But it must pass back to the menu, for reendering

disabled is an internal property (which may be set from here and there). 
It seems to go in the handler, as an overall item state (like required). But is hidden, so not config. Maybe BoundHandler?
It must work late, to accound for vaalidation
It must pass to the renders
