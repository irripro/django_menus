To build menu items from a variety of sources (other menus, external links, models (ansolute URLS, reverse URLS)).
To hard-code the menu itself (no looping in templates)
Rendering as tabs or lists?
path delivery
permission handling
auto generation

don't care
----------
Code or model
GUI
parent/sibling
trees in general

Also, there is a computational question about implementation. According to the discussion about relative databases, a 'category' is not part of a Model (it is 'the truth', it is 'the whole truth', but it is not 'and nothing but the truth'). So a Model category should be kept in a seperate table. But there is a case to keep categories as part of a Model. In practice, a category will be closely bound, may well be specific, to one model only. Keeping category data on the model itself keeps table data compacted and relevant (one downside would be if query joins became complex, which is one of the prime reasons for normalising. Another would be clarity for database maintenence. But if binding to one type of object is assured, both these use cases become less of a hinderance).

----
# form
-- value
> boundfield
initial or from widget via self.data dict(), then prepare
__str__ renders widget
> widget in render, format, put in context

-- errors
form: control, render
boundfield: picks them up, checks against form, adds them to css_classes (irreversible)
-- required
boundfield: rescues these in the label and css_classes, checking the field
--disabled
field: on field as attribute
boundfield: check field, set in wiget_attrs
--hidden
boundfield: written
--attrs
boundfield: check if field is required or disabled, then add (irreverable)

# menu
If it needs to be permanent information that a user can set, like 'required' , put it on the handler. In truth, nothing we have is like this. No---attributes, classes 'expand'. Build these in.

So handler needs a writable css_classes? #? Which checks expand - No
Expand can be forced on by menu?
Select forced by menu, how?
Disable forced by menu, how? from where?
Maybe pass selected chain to boundhandler? or request to handler?
